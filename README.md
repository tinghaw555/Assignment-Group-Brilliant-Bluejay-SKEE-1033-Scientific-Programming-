## 1.0 Introduction

Python is a widely used programming language in data analysis due to its simplicity, flexibility, and extensive libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. These tools allow efficient data cleaning, analysis, visualisation, and predictive modelling, making Python highly suitable for engineering and energy-related studies.

In this assignment, Python is used to analyse household electricity consumption data collected from Urban, Suburban, and Rural regions between 2018 and 2022. The dataset includes monthly electricity consumption, electricity cost, and the number of occupants per household. Through data cleaning, descriptive analysis, visualisation, and predictive modelling, this assignment aims to understand electricity usage patterns and predict electricity costs based on consumption behaviour and household size.

## 2.0 Objective

The aim of this assignment is to apply the data analytics knowledge learned in class to analyse household electricity consumption using a given dataset. The analysis focuses on understanding electricity usage patterns across different regions and examining the factors that influence electricity cost. In addition, a predictive model is developed and evaluated to estimate electricity costs based on consumption and household occupancy. Throughout this assignment, the objectives are to:

1. Identify missing values and data issues such as outliers and handle them using appropriate techniques.  
2. Perform descriptive statistical analysis and correlation analysis to study the relationship between electricity consumption and household size.  
3. Visualise electricity consumption trends and regional differences using line and scatter plots.  
4. Develop and evaluate a linear regression model to predict electricity cost using R-squared (R²) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## 4.0 Task 1 – Data Cleaning Process

- Inspect the dataset for missing values and outliers using Python libraries such as pandas and numpy.

- Document the number of missing values and describe how you will handle them (e.g., using mean, median or interpolation)

- Detect and handle outliers in electricty consumption and cost using the interquartile Range(IQR) or Z-score method.

- Code and procedure refer to code cells.
---
## 5.0 Task 2 – Descriptive Data Analysis

- Compute summary statistics (mean, median and standard deviation) for Consumption_kWh and Cost_RM by region)
- Analyse the relationship between consumption and number of occupants using a correlation coefficient.
- Comment on any observable relationship patterns.
- Code and procedure refer to code cells.

---
## 6.0 Task 3 – Data Visualisation

- Plot monthly consumption trends for each region using line graphs.
 - Create a multi-line plot comparing all three regions.
- Plot a scatter plot showing the relationship between the number of occupant and electricity consumption.
- Explain any outlier or unusual patterns observed in the graphs, such as sudden spikes in consumption or irregular points in the scatter plot.
- Code and procedure refer to code cells.

---
## 7.0 Task 4 – Prediction Analysis

-	Build a linear Regression model to predict electricity cost (Cost_RM) based on consumption and number of occupants.
1.	Split the dataset into training and training sets (80:20 ratio).
2.	Train the linear regression model.
3.	Evaluate its performance using R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
4. Plot Actual vs Predicted Electricity Cost and include a red dashed line (y = x) to represent perfect
prediction.
- Points above the line → over-predicted values.
- Points below the line → under-predicted values.
- Code and procedure refer to code cells.

## 8.0 Conclusion

This assignment demonstrates the practical use of Python for analysing household electricity consumption data from urban, suburban, and rural areas between 2018 and 2022. Data cleaning techniques such as interpolation and the IQR method were used to handle missing values and identify outliers, improving the quality of the dataset.

The analysis revealed differences in electricity usage across regions, with larger households generally consuming more electricity. Correlation analysis and visualisations helped identify relationships, trends, and unusual patterns. A linear regression model was developed to predict electricity costs and evaluated using R-squared and MAE, showing reasonable accuracy. Overall, the use of Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib highlights the importance of data analysis skills in supporting forecasting and informed decision-making.
